This is the GraphingWiki MoinMoin extension. 

Note: Most functionality is intended to work in MoinMoin versions from
1.3.5 upwards, but RenamePage and perhaps some other functionality
might work only in versions 1.5+.

INSTALL
=======

Preconditions:
 - Python 2.4 and Graphviz 2.8+ along with its python bindings,
   available from graphviz.org as graphviz-<version>.rpm and
   graphviz-python-<version>.rpm. Source installs need to be built
   with --enable-python.

 - The lockfile executable from the procmail mail processing suite is
   used to prevent concurrent index file writes. The system has been
   tested with version v3.22 timestamped 2001/09/10.

 - MoinMoin 1.3.4+ installed. Graphingwiki has been tested with
   MoinMoin versions 1.3.4, 1.3.5 and 1.5.3.

 - A MoinMoin wiki installed in directory WIKIDIR (with config
   directory in WIKIDIR/config and data in WIKIDIR/data)

1. Install the python extension
   % python setup.py install

2. Install SecurityPolicy to be used with GraphingWiki
   % cat wikiconfig-add.txt >> /WIKIDIR/config/wikiconfig.py

3. Install plugins to wiki
   % gwiki-install WIKIDIR

4. Populate the graph data of existing pages
   % gwiki-rehash WIKIDIR

After this, you should be all set and ShowGraph should show in the
wiki's action menu. If not, check permissions of
site-packages/graphingwiki, site-packages/MoinMoin, plugins and
config.
