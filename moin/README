This is the Graphingwiki MoinMoin extension. 

INSTALL
=======

Preconditions:
 - Python 2.4 and Graphviz 2.8+ along with its python bindings,
   available from graphviz.org as graphviz-<version>.rpm and
   graphviz-python-<version>.rpm. Source installs need to be built
   with --enable-python.

 - The lockfile executable from the procmail mail processing suite is
   used to prevent concurrent index file writes. The system has been
   tested with version v3.22 timestamped 2001/09/10.

 - MoinMoin 1.3.5 installed. Graphingwiki might work with other
   versions as well, but requires changing MoinMoin/PageEditor.py
   accordingly.

 - A MoinMoin wiki installed in directory WIKIDIR (with config
   directory in WIKIDIR/config and data in WIKIDIR/data)

1. Install the python extension
   % python setup.py install

2. Install changes to MoinMoin, either 
 - site-wide install
   % patch < moinmoin-1.3.5-PageEditor.patch
   Fedora installs may need to use
   % patch -F 3 < moinmoin-1.3.5-PageEditor.patch
   After patch, recompile PageEditor
   % echo "from MoinMoin import PageEditor" | python

 - per-wiki install
   % cp -R MoinMoin WIKIDIR/config

3. Install plugins to wiki
   % gwiki-install WIKIDIR

4. Populate the graph data of existing pages
   % gwiki-rehash WIKIDIR

After this, you should be all set and ShowGraph should show in the
wiki's action menu. If not, check permissions of
site-packages/graphingwiki, site-packages/MoinMoin, plugins and
config.
