*0.41 (BETA STAGE)

- ShowGraph now supports coloring and ordering by categories (BETA,
  untested)

- New macro, LinkedIn, shows pages that link to the current page
  (BETA, untested)

- Added moin-showpage-script, which enhances command line interaction
  with MoinMoin. At the same time, gwiki-showgraph was modified so
  that it is essentially a wrapper around moin-showpage.

- Changed the handling of the MetaData values of shape, label, sides,
  skew and orientation in savegraphdata so that they can ve used to
  affect graph layout. Information about the use of these attributes
  at: http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html

- Added ShowProcessGraph action as an example of customising and
  extending ShowGraph (i.e. I had to make some process graphs and
  patch quickly this little toy for the task).

- Removed euler.pyc, which got into the first distro packet by
  accident in the first place. 

*0.4

- Original version with 5 of the 11 secret ingredients included.
