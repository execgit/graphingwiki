You can use the excellent MIT SIMILE javascript widgets with
Graphingwiki. The widget code was copied here from the SIMILE svn
repository.

http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/

Usage:

You need to add the following line to your wikiconfig:

html_head = '<script src="%s/simile/timeline/timeline-api.js" type="text/javascript"></script>\n' % (url_prefix)

The simile directory should be placed in the directory as specified by
the url_prefix variable in the wikiconfig. 

Then, try adding [[RecentChangesTimeline]] to a page, and enjoy!
