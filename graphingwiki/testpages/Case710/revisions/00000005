Create pages ''SomePage'' and ''[[some page]]'', rename them, and check that the following links will change:

SomePage

[[some page]]

[[some page|some Page]]

[[some page|some Page|target="_blank"]]

[[some page|{{attachment:samplegraphic.png}}]]

[[some page|{{attachment:samplegraphic.png}}|target="_blank"]] 

../SomePage or [[../some page|link text]]

The links below should not change. Then, make a subpage /SomePage, rename it, and see that only they change.

/SomePage or [[/some page]]
