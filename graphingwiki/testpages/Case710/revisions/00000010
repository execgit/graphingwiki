Create pages ''SomePage'' and ''[[some page]]'', rename them, and check that the following links will change:

SomePage

[[some page]]

[[some page|some Page]]

[[some page|some Page|target="_blank"]]

[[some page|{{attachment:samplegraphic.png}}]]

[[some page|{{attachment:samplegraphic.png}}|target="_blank"]] 

../SomePage or [[../some page|link text]]

The links below should not change. Then, make subpages [[Case710/SomePage]] and [[Case710/some page]], rename them, and see that only links to them change.

/SomePage, [[/some page]], [[/some page|link text|target="_blank"]]

[[../Case710/some page]]
