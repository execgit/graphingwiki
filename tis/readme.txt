TIS (or Total Internet Simulator) is a malware traffic analysis environment initially made in the OUSPG during 2007-2008.
The system uses the vmware server to run virtual images, that are infected with the investigated malware. The infected images
traffic is then analysed to detect interesting real world infrastructure that the malware tries to use. The results were then
presented in the graphing wiki.

After the project the scripts used in the analysis were moved to open source. Use at your own risk: Sanityloss imminent. :)

folders are:
  butler - server scripts
  scripts - scripts mounted into virtual machines and some testing scripts
  surlper - prototype url anlayzer
  toolz - 3rd party tools used in some analysis. Thanks Toni koivunen / TEAMFURRY.

Special thanks to e, fenris, madder, ping and all in OUSPG. :)
