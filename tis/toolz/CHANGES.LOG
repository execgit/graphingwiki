[1.1.0]
	* Major upgrade. Due to a slight stupidity that is now fixed the scan is about 15-20 times
	  faster than before :)
	* Added Extended Databases. SigBuster can now be ordered to scan for magic bytes, exploit signatures
	  and AntiDebug signatures by adding -ed to the command switches. The additional databases are also
	  updated with the -u switch.

[1.0.5]
	* Update site has been changed. Some minor modifications were also done, but they
	  should be transparent to the user.

[1.0.4]
	* Fixed scanning for signatures with a wildcard at the beginning
	* Added a -dd switch to delete all detected files, leaving only undetected intact
	
[1.0.3]
	* Fixed the -fast switch
	* Thanks to awesome job done by CERT/CC all the broken signatures should now be history
	* The signature database allows comments prefixed with #, as long as they exist outside
	  the three lines of the signature definition.
	* Purged the compiler signatures from the DB. If you'd like to have them, contact me.
	* If no signatures are detected, but entropy suggests the file is packed the following "detection" is given:
	  [NoSig, Entropy suggests the file is packed]
	  
[1.0.2]
	* Reduced the noise and did a few small improvements.

[1.0.1]
	* Added ShutdownHook to display statistics when user presses Ctrl+C
	* Rewrote the whole scanner engine :) It's about 65% faster now...

[0.9.2]
	* Bugfix concerning -pfp and -m used at the same time.
	* Small optimizations done to speed up the scanning.
[0.9]
	* Made SigBuster Java 1.4 compliant
	* Added recursion
	* Added entropy calculations for undetected files. (Entropy will not be mentioned when using -qq)
	* Quiet-mode (-q) will now show if the file is not a valid PE file)
	* Added new switch (-pfp) to show full path/filenames regardless of possible quietmode.

[0.8]
	* Changed behaviour so that instead of moving anything only copying takes place...
	* Added a -q option to make the program be quiet :) gives out only <filename><tab><signature>
	  and the statistics at the end of the scan. Use -qq to drop the statistics too.
	* Fixed the -u option. Updating works now...

[0.7]
	* Fixed a glitch in the code. It's a _lot_ faster now :)

	* Added 6 new signatures

[0.6]
	* Added a -u switch, which will download a new signature db and overwrite the old one.

	* Added signature for NsPack (ep_only = true)
	* Added signature for petite (ep_only = true)
	* Added signature for ASPack 2.12 (ep_only = true)
	* Added signatures for unknown versions of Morphine (ep_only = true)
	* Fixed the anxau.com signature ;)

[0.5]
	* Added a -o switch, which will copy the binaries to directories named after the packer
	
	* Cleaned up the signature db a bit to get rid of some of the signatures that caused a lot
	  of duplicates for same packers.
	* Added a proper signature for PolyEne 0.01+ (ep_only = false)
	* Added signature for UPX-Scrambler RC1.x (ep_only = true)
	* Added separate signature for UPX 1.25 (ep_only = true)
	* Added signature for NsPack (ep_only = true)
	* Added signature for PC Shrinker 0.71 -> Virogen (ep_only = true)
	* Added partial signature for DotFix (ep_only = false)

[0.4]
	* Fixed a minor bug in the detection rate counting.
	* Added a -fast switch. This will stop scanning on first hit. It will then move to the next file.
	* Optimized the signatureloading to put the (ep_only = true) signatures first, others after that.
	* If -m is given, all the files SigBuster thinks are corrupt will get a .corrupt in their filename
	* Fixed a bug on -m switch. It failed to delete the file after copying if an exception had occurred in the scan.
	* Modified the summary to show statistics on signature matches.
	
	* Added detection for Petite 2.3 (ep_only = true)
	* Added detection for ASProtect 1.2x - 1.3x (ep_only = true)
	* Added detection for UPX 1.24 (ep_only = true)
	* Added 2 detections for PECompact 2.x (ep_only = true)
	* Added partial signature for DotFix v3.4 (ep_only = false)
	* Added detection for UPX 0.80 - 1.25 (ep_only = true)
	* Added detection for ASPack 2.x (without poly) (ep_only = true)
	* Added 2 detections for SVK Protector (SVKP) (ep_only = true)
	* Added detection for SVKP 1.3x (ep_only = true)
	* Added detection for PolyCrypt PE (ep_only = false)
	* Removed the PolyEnE detection, since the signature gave waaaay too many false positives :(
